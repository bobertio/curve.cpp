Day 1:[Today is Friday, September 23rd] Going through/refining the general psuedocode for the first couple of phases
  Goals: I really want to set up void commands so I won't have to do too much of the heavy lifting later for else if and for statements. 
         I also want to see how many new things I can learn in order to refine what I have. My goal is to make the program run on as little code
         but as efficiently as possible. There was this technique I saw on a video where he put seperate code on another file in the same IDE, and he 
         called on it during the session using commands. I wanted to learn how to do that so I can code up seperate features in seperate spaces from the 
         main code. I will update at the end of the day to show what I have done.


Day 2: [Today is November 24, Thanksgiving Thursday] I have not been updating the diary because I moved across the country and it took my stuff some time to get here, but we're back into the swing of things. I discovered that I can use excel as a database to store some of the information I needed for some of the features I planned on intergrating, especially things like the college choice list. As of now I am gathering the top colleges from all of the 50 states according to Niche to place in my program as the first tests. I most likely won't end up putting all of the 50 states in there, but it's good to have them since I am going to work on this for my resume as well.
