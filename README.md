# curve.cpp
A GPA and grade calculator with a predictive grade feature.
This is my first coding project and my final project for my intro to C++ class.
Creating a github repository is not needed for the grade, but I thought that it would be nice to start getting used to a tool like github as early as possible.
I am a rookie coder with minimal experience so I will create a dairy of sorts to track my progress as I go along. 
This repository is public because if I do manage to make this project work, it can be used as an and as a journey log for beginner coders as well looking for projects they can view and replicate.

Thank you and I hope to see you at the end of this journey
